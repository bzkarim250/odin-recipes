    <h3>Haitian-Style Fried Chicken</h3>
    <p>
        Also known as Poul Fri, Haitian Fried Chicken (Recette poulet frit) skips the batter of the American style dish and instead infuses the meat with aromatic spices and seasonings.

        <li>3 pounds chicken legs</li>
        <li>a half white onion, chopped</li>

    <h3>Step-By-Step To make Haitian-Style Fried Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine chicken legs, lemon juice, onion, garlic, seasoned salt, paprika, thyme, pepper, and cloves in a large bowl.
            Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in batches until golden brown, about 8
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain on paper towels.
